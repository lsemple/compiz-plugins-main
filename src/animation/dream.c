/*
 * TODO:
 *
 * - Auto direction option: Close in opposite direction of opening
 * - Proper side surface normals for lighting
 * - decoration shadows
 *   - shadow quad generation
 *   - shadow texture coords (from clip tex. matrices)
 *   - draw shadows
 *   - fade in shadows
 *
 * - Voronoi tessellation
 * - Brick tessellation
 * - Triangle tessellation
 * - Hexagonal tessellation
 *
 * Effects:
 * - Circular action for tornado type fx
 * - Tornado 3D (especially for minimize)
 * - Helix 3D (hor. strips descend while they rotate and fade in)
 * - Glass breaking 3D
 *   - Gaussian distr. points (for gradually increasing polygon size
 *                           starting from center or near mouse pointer)
 *   - Drawing cracks
 *   - Gradual cracking
 *
 * - fix slowness during transparent cube with <100 opacity
 * - fix occasional wrong side color in some windows
 * - fix on top windows and panels
 *   (These two only matter for viewing during Rotate Cube.
 *    All windows should be painted with depth test on
 *    like 3d-plugin does)
 * - play better with rotate (fix cube face drawn on top of polygons
 *   after 45 deg. rotation)
